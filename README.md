## About Pokedex

This is a simple ui that shows all pokemons with their images, names and types. In detailed pokemon pages, you can see a short description, base stats, and evolution chain of that pokemon.

## Project Details

Project is written with [React](https://reactjs.org/). [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) is used for styling.  [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is used for deployment.

The data is provided by [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). There are huge amounts of data in PokéAPI, but I prefered to use just the basic ones for simplicity purposes. You should check it out :)
